# create_fat32_image.sh

This script is a Bash utility designed to create a FAT32 disk image from either a 7zip archive or the contents of a specified directory.

It was created to set up a USB Mass Storage Gadget (MSG) on devices like the Raspberry Pi 4B, allowing them to function as a USB drive via their USB-C port.<br/>
To read more about using RPi 4B as USB storage device see [RPi USB Mass Storage presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Lz8w8MNY1QSk-mqhAnVPvj5aa0PITCZMUNTZzEpRkQ/edit?usp=sharing).
